The Northwind Traders dataset is a toy database created by Microsoft for educational purposes. This fictitious company sells specialty foods wholesale to retail outlets worldwide. The database contains data for 801 orders placed by 85 different customers over the course of 23 months, complete with supplementary information on customers, employees, and suppliers. For this study, the goal was to extract insights from the data which could facilitate more revenue for the company. Two things which are generally good for business are the customers 1) buying more products, and 2) buying more often. Since the customers of Northwind Traders are retailers, a discount on their order means a higher profit margin for them, potentially generating buyer incentive as well as customer loyalty. This study sought to investigate two questions as they relate to best reaching these goals: how much discount should be offered, and how frequently should it be offered? Since offering larger or more frequent discounts has a negative effect on the profit that can be made off of an order by NT, it is important to determine whether there is a threshold at which this loss of revenue ceases to be justified by the effects being generated.
