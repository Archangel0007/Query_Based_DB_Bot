Project Goal
 
To migrate a retail company's sales, inventory, and customer data from flat CSV files (exported from a legacy system) into a MySQL database, using Generative AI (GenAI) to speed up and validate every step of the process.

The 5-Step Migration Process
 
1. Schema Design with GenAI
 
· Input: Provide the column names and data types from your CSV files to a GenAI tool.
· AI's Role: The AI generates the necessary CREATE TABLE scripts for MySQL, including primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. It also produces a data dictionary.
· Your Role: Review and refine the AI-generated schema.
· Outcome: A finalized, ready-to-use database schema in MySQL.
 
2. Data Import & Validation
 
· Action: Import the CSV data into the newly created MySQL tables.
· AI's Role: Help write and run validation queries to ensure:
· The row counts in the database match the original CSVs.
· Foreign key relationships are valid (e.g., every product_id in the sales table exists in the product table).
· Critical totals (like the sum of sales) match between the source and destination.
· Outcome: Confidence that the data has been loaded correctly and is ready for use.
 
3. Query & Logic Translation
 
· Input: Provide any existing business logic—such as Oracle PL/SQL procedures or queries—to the GenAI tool.
· AI's Role: Translate this legacy code into syntactically correct MySQL code.
· Your Role: Check the results against expected outputs to ensure accuracy.
· Outcome: All business rules and queries are functional in the new MySQL environment.
 
4. Automated Testing with GenAI
 
· AI's Role: Generate test cases and SQL queries to automatically check data quality and business logic. Examples include:
· "Find orders without corresponding invoices."
· "Ensure there are no negative sales amounts."
· Action: Run these tests on your database.
· Outcome: A tested, reliable, and consistent database.
 
5. BI Reporting & Insights
 
· AI's Role: Assist in writing SQL queries to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as:
· Monthly sales trends and revenue vs. forecast.
· Top-selling products and most valuable customers.
· Supplier delivery delays.
· Visualization: Connect the MySQL database to a BI tool (like Power BI or Qlik) to create dashboards and visual reports.
